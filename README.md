# ASCII-Art
Conversion from an image / video to ASCII text, using PIL

Images to be converted will go into input_images. The converted text will be in output_text. output_images holds the actual processed image that is used for converting to text.
Videos to be converted will go into input_videos. There are two different versions to convert to: video or text file. Use vid_to_vid.py to convert to videos and vid_to_text.py to convert to text (read_text.py is used to view the text).
